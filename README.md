# Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship â€“ Daikibo Telemetry Dashboard ðŸ“Š

This project was completed as part of the **Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship** hosted on the [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/) platform. The task involved analyzing telemetry data from a fictional company called **Daikibo** using Tableau to identify patterns in machine downtime and draw actionable insights.

##  Objective

To analyze device health data and visualize potential machine downtimes across factories and device types. The main goal was to highlight inefficiencies through visual dashboards and propose data-driven insights.

##  Tools Used

- Tableau Desktop (Free Trial)
- JSON Dataset
- Calculated Fields
- Interactive Dashboards

## ðŸ“Š Project Tasks

1. Imported telemetry data from a `.json` file into Tableau.
2. Created a calculated measure field called **Unhealthy**, assigning 10 minutes of downtime to each "unhealthy" status message.
3. Built two bar charts:
   - **Down Time per Factory**
   - **Down Time per Device Type**
4. Designed an **interactive dashboard** with:
   - Factory chart as a filter for device types
   - Visual drill-down functionality
5. Selected the factory with the **most downtime** for deeper analysis.


## ðŸ’¡ Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Calculated Fields in Tableau
- Visual Analytics & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Dashboard Design & Interactivity
- Communication of Business Insights

## ðŸ§  Insights

By identifying which factories and device types contributed the most to downtime, this analysis can help management make decisions on equipment upgrades, preventive maintenance, or further investigation into problem areas.
